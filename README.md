    Spencer (sorbet)
  
DESCRIPTION
    C++/QML developer, although I dabble in various other languages as well (Python, Rust, etc.).
    
    Repositories contained herein are for storage and portfolio purposes first, and public distribution second.
    Unless explicitly stated otherwise, code distributed here is done without any promise or expectation of 
    maintenance, bug-fixing, or support. Pull-requests are welcome, but issues (if enabled at all) will go
    ignored.
    
    These repositories are just hobby projects that I've decided to host publicly. If you find a 
    personal use for them, awesome! Any bugfixes or improvements that you'd like to see made, however, should 
    be done yourself; please do not contact me regarding issues you want me to fix.
